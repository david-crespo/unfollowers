# Unfollowers

A script that downloads all your Twitter followers, compares the current list of followers to the list from the previous run, and notifies you of any unfollowers through IFTTT. It is meant to be run on Heroku, but could be modified to run anywhere.

### Limitations

- Only looks at your first 5000 followers
- If more than 100 people unfollowed you, you will only see the first 100

Both of these are because I didn't need to implement paging for my own small number of followers.

## How to host with Heroku and IFTTT

### Twitter

1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com and create a new app with read only permissions
1. On the **Keys and Access Tokens** page, note the consumer key and secret and the access token and token secret. You will need to set them as config vars in Heroku (see below).

### IFTTT

1. Create an account, obviously
1. Connect the **Webhooks** service and take note of the URL that looks like `https://maker.ifttt.com/use/<IFTTT_KEY>`. You will need this key (see below).
1. Create a Webhooks applet with an event `new_unfollowers` as its trigger and a notification as its effect. Set `{{Value1}}` as the contents of the notification.
1. Install the IFTTT app on your phone and log in. Make sure you give it permission to send you notifications.

### Heroku

1. Create an app on Heroku
1. Install plugin **Heroku Scheduler**
1. Install plugin **Heroku Redis** (this will automatically set the `REDIS_URL` config var)
1. Clone this repo and add your Heroku app as a remote with `heroku git:remote -a <heroku_app_name>`
1. Manually set the following config variables in Heroku, under **Settings**:

   | Key                  | Description                         |
   | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
   | `IFTTT_KEY`          | The key from the IFTTT Webhooks URL |
   | `TW_CONSUMER_KEY`    | Consumer Key (API Key)              |
   | `TW_CONSUMER_SECRET` | Consumer Secret (API Secret)        |
   | `TW_TOKEN`           | Access Token                        |
   | `TW_SECRET`          | Access Token Secret                 |

   `REDIS_URL` is automatically set by the Redis plugin.

1. Deploy to Heroku with `git push heroku master`
1. Click Heroku Scheduler on the overview page and add a new job that runs `node src/index.js` every 10 minutes (or hourly, or daily)

## Running it locally first to test that it works

1. Go through almost all the steps above (you only need up to step 3 in Heroku â€” no need to deploy)
1. Install Node if you don't have it (I've only tested this with Node 8.4.0)
1. Run `npm i` in the repo directory
1. Set all of the above environment variables locally, including `REDIS_URL`. The easiest way to do that is to make a file called `.env` that looks like this

   ```
   export IFTTT_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export TW_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export TW_CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export TW_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export TW_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   export REDIS_URL=xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   and run it with `source .env`.

1. Run `node src/index.js`. Output should look like this:

   ```
   $ node src/index.js
   Current followers: <curr>
   Previous followers: <prev>
   Saving <curr> followers to redis
   Found <prev - curr> unfollowers
   ```

   That proves the connections to Redis and Twitter are working.

1. Run `node src/test-notification.js`. Output should look like this

   ```
   $ node src/test-notification.js
   Posted to IFTTT: "This is a test notification!"
   ```

   and you should get a notification on your phone.
